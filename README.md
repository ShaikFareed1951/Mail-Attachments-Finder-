you will need to provide an app password to log in to your account programmatically. 
 An app password is a unique code that allows a specific application to access your email account without requiring you to enter your full password. Here's how to generate an app password:

    1. Go to your email account's security settings. This may be found in the account settings, security settings, or account   security settings.

    2.Look for the option to manage app passwords. This may be called "App Passwords," "Third-party App Passwords," or something similar.

    3.Follow the steps to generate an app password. Some email providers allow you to generate a specific password for a specific app, while others provide a single password that can be used with multiple apps.

    4.Use the app password in place of your regular password when logging in to your email account programmatically.

Note: The steps to generate an app password may vary depending on your email provider. If you are having trouble generating an app password, consult your email provider's documentation or support resources for more information.

# Code Explanation
  
  This is a python script that connects to a Gmail account and retrieves attachments from emails received from a specific email address. The script can be executed in a terminal or command line and will prompt the user to enter their Gmail email address, password, and the target email address to search for attachments.

Here's an explanation of each part of the code:

    1.import imaplib: This imports the imaplib library, which provides the IMAP protocol client capabilities to the script.

    2.import email: This imports the email library, which is used to parse the raw email data retrieved from the Gmail account.

    3.import os: This imports the os library, which provides a way to interact with the operating system, such as creating and deleting files.

    4.def get_attachments(email_id, mail): This is a function that takes an email ID and a mail object as parameters and returns the attachments of the email. The function retrieves the raw email data using the mail.fetch() method and the email ID, and then converts the raw data into an email object using the email.message_from_bytes() method. The function then iterates through the parts of the email object using the walk() method and adds the filename of any part with a content-disposition header to the list of attachments.

    5.def display_attachments(mail, target_email_address): This is a function that takes a mail object and a target email address as parameters and displays the attachments of emails received from the target email address. The function selects the inbox of the Gmail account using the mail.select() method and then searches for emails received from the target email address using the mail.search() method. The function then calls the get_attachments() function for each email ID found and adds the attachments to the list of attachments. The function then prints the attachments if any attachments were found, or a message indicating no attachments were found.

    6.if __name__ == '__main__':: This is a check that ensures the code block inside this conditional statement is only executed if the script is being run as the main program, and not as an imported module.

    7.email_address = input("Enter your Gmail address: "): This line prompts the user to enter their Gmail email address, which is stored in the email_address variable.

    8.password = input("Enter your Gmail password: "): This line prompts the user to enter their Gmail password, which is stored in the password variable.

    9.target_email_address = input("Enter the target Gmail address: "): This line prompts the user to enter the target email address, which is stored in the target_email_address variable.

    10.mail = imaplib.IMAP4_SSL("imap.gmail.com"): This line creates an IMAP4 client object using SSL, which is used to securely connect to the Gmail server.

    11.mail.login(email_address, password): This line logs into the Gmail account using the email_address and password variables.

    12.display_attachments(mail, target_email_address): This line calls the display_attachments() function and passes the mail object and the target_email_address variable as parameters.
    
# example of how the code would run:
    
      Enter your Gmail address: example@gmail.com
      Enter your Gmail password: ********
      Enter the target Gmail address: target@gmail.com
      Attachments:
      attachment1.pdf
      attachment2.jpg
      attachment3.docx

      In this example, the user is prompted to enter their Gmail address, password, and the target email address. The code logs in to the Gmail account using the provided email address and password and then fetches all the emails from the target email address. Finally, it displays the attachments of all the emails fetched.
